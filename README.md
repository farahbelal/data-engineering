### *1. Which borough consistently has the highest number of persons involved in motor vehicle crashes?*
*   *Answer:* Based on the "Persons Involved in Crashes per Year by Borough" chart, *Brooklyn* consistently has the highest number of persons involved in crashes across all displayed years (2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024). It is followed by Queens and the Bronx.

### *2. How did the COVID-19 pandemic appear to impact the total number of people involved in crashes in NYC?*
*   *Answer:* The "Number of Involved Persons per Year" chart shows a significant dip in the number of people involved in crashes around the years *2020 and 2021*. This sharp decrease is very likely linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lockdowns, remote work, and drastically reduced traffic volume. The numbers then begin to recover in subsequent years.

### *3. What is the most common injury outcome for persons involved in crashes, and is this consistent across all boroughs?*
*   *Answer:* The "Persons by Injury Outcome and Borough" chart indicates that *"Injured"* is by far the most common outcome. This pattern is consistent across all boroughs, including Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island. "Killed" represents a much smaller segment of the outcomes in every borough.

---

### *4. Is there a visible difference in the age distribution of people involved in crashes between the boroughs?*
*   *Answer:* Yes, the "Person Age by Borough" chart shows clear differences. *Staten Island* has a noticeably older population of people involved in crashes, while *Brooklyn* has a noticeably younger population. The other boroughs (Bronx, Manhattan, Queens) fall somewhere in between these two extremes.

---

### *5. Which age group appears to be most vulnerable to fatal outcomes in crashes?*
*   *Answer:* According to the "Person Age by Injury Outcome" chart, the age profile for individuals listed as *"Killed"* is skewed significantly older. While people in their 20s and 30s make up a large portion of the "Injured," the proportion of older adults (likely 50+) is much higher among fatalities, indicating they are more vulnerable to fatal outcomes.

---

### *6. Has the number of pedestrians involved in crashes shown a significant increasing or decreasing trend from 2012 to 2024?*
*   *Answer:* No. The "Number of Pedestrians Involved in Crashes per Year" chart shows that the number has *remained relatively stable* over this period. The values fluctuate within a very narrow range (approximately 10,400 to 11,600), with no clear, sustained upward or downward trend.

---

### *7. What is the most common type of person (e.g., occupant, pedestrian) involved in crashes that result in injury or death?*
*   *Answer:* The "Persons by Type and Injury Outcome" chart shows that *"Occupants"* (which includes drivers and passengers of vehicles) represent the largest number of individuals in both the "Injured" and "Killed" categories. This is followed by pedestrians, who also show a significant number of injuries.

---

### *8. Are pedestrians in certain boroughs more or less likely to be injured compared to others?*
*   *Answer:* The "Pedestrian Injury Outcomes by Borough" chart suggests that the likelihood of a pedestrian being injured, once involved in a crash, is *consistently high across all boroughs*. In every borough, the vast majority of pedestrians involved in crashes are categorized as "Injured." There is no borough that shows a dramatically different pattern, such as a much lower injury rate.
